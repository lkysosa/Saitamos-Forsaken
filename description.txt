Saitamos Forsaken is an obvious WIP content mod, I will be frequently updating this mod and fixing and adding bugs, so consider this a teaser almost.

There is currently very little in the mod, but still enough to get a taste. Development is solo by me, but if you want to join me, let me know on discord Sosa God#0123
I am also looking to merge with other small mods which died or have very little going on. but enough talking and enjoy watching the mod grow

-SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK AS INTENDED OR LOOK OFF OR ODD, I JUST WANTED TO GET OUT A TASTE I SUPPOSE- Disclaimer.

Heres The Discord, always down to talk about stuff in there https://discord.gg/SpPPJ8W


I will list all updates in description (Currently v.0.1)

RELEASE 1.0
CURRENTLY: 
- Tarot cards to improve builds 
- Tinkering, so pretty much adding some handles and blade heads, not very much at all rn will work on alot as i progress
- Reaper class: Mostly fleshed out, but still looking to make more interesting
- Alot of Rare drops and such to add more to collect
-Spells, will take spellcharges and mostly wont be class restricted. Pretty powerful and interesting to use
-RPG styled armors and they can be randomly rolled with different perks.
-No mobs(I think) and no bosses, dont really plan on adding any soon.
-Fleshed out the classes a tiny bit, still working on them.
-Alchemist class, heavily in wip, working to make them interesting as well.
- The concept of exotics and special weapons.
Assasin class: Replacing thrower, but still compatible with thrower items. Working on scrolls similar but very different from thoriums
